"IHORR SMSD: This PD was the most relevant to my subject I have ever been to.� I like their philosophy and it's relevance to my teaching.Seeing how to use cooperative groups within my curriculum.� Change up what is served for lunch. 4 days of the same thing got really old. ",
"QTNTH3V GMAIL: Even if EMI is not applicable to the school/district we teach at  the techniques and perspectives learn from the seminar are still useful in normal classroom. I enjoy learning new approach and learning different teachers' logic and technique",
"DYOUNG BLUEVALLEYK12: The collaborative atmosphere is what we need to be teaching in our classrooms. This experience helps us understand what that actually looks like. This is my second year attending - I find value in what the EMI workshop offers. Even without the grant money for the stipend  I had planned on attending this year. If it's not available next year  I will still attend if the dates match my schedule. I saw such creative ways of solving problems  especially in the Geometry afternoon section.� Got a chance to think about what true problem-based learning is about. When I see things at PD in the district about it  it's difficult to see how math can implement PBL with GOOD problems. EMI gave some great activities. Only real complaint of the week was lunch. I know it's difficult to plan for everyone's dietary needs  but I wonder if it would have been possible to have a menu where people could have chosen what they wanted for lunch the next day? The first day have a set couple of options  then provide a menu to something like Jason's Deli or Panera for the rest of the week. Even if you needed to charge more $ to cover more expensive lunches I think it would have been better. Last year  when it was held at Rockhurst  having different meals each day was really nice. I know there were more participants this year and I assume the kitchen was closed  which may have influenced what was done  but by the end of day 2  many participants were grousing about whether lunch was going to be the same each day. Several chose to go out for lunch instead  which meant they weren't there for the presentations at lunch.� LOVE EMI!!!!!! Keep bringing them back!",
"WRJENSON SMSD:  Helped me feel that potentially inferior complex that students likely feel too often; this will help me understand them better.� Student desk/chair of was a hard surface  way to sit for so many hours. ",
"NANCYBRIXEY YAHOO: I went last year and brought two colleagues with me this year. On the way to and from the institute  we had more meaningful discussions about problem solving and critical thinking and what changes need to happen in our classrooms to get students to be problem solvers who use great mathematical practices. I will definitely attend at least one as I did this year being my second year. I went to two my first year. One gives me a refresher and keeps me thinking about what I need to do as an educator to help my students be the best they can be. I learned how to solve math problems in a way that was different than my own way.� I was reminded of the importance to continually make the changes in my pedagogy that will increase student engagement and problem solving. I think it would be great if  at some point  you would get all teachers in one room  then have them break-out by subject level they teach so we can have more specific math talk about their specific area to share some concerns  offer suggestions or to just make the contact for a future resource. This might be better if done on day 3 or 4. As a second year attendee  you asked me to be on the discussion panel after lunch. My goal this year is to video tape what Exeter looks like in my room to bring next year as a presentation. If I can accomplish this task  I will send it to Greg to preview. After the preview  and you want me to present  I will be happy to.",
"AWALKER SVNCHARTER:  ",
"KMALOTT FRONTIERSCHOOLS: This was the best professional development I have attended so far.I was reminded that it is okay for me to make mistakes too. I can't wait for the school year to begin so I can try some of the things I learned this week. There were several middle school teachers in the algebra one classes. It might be good to have a pre-algebra or middle school based course. ",
"GROENEA BISHOPMIEGE: I think it is a great opportunity for other educators to continue their learning in a meaningful way.� I have attended twice. I would like to do algebra 2 courses but I am not sure ignore my plans next year.� Teachers like students learn differently. So we teach differently. Through charts or algebraically solving the problem  it's always nice to see how you can't improve yourself just as we ask our students to do the same.� 2nd time. Just as good. Keeps me reminded to find what helps my students not just in my class but as men and women in the world.� Work with other teachers earliernin the algebra 1 course. I felt like at the beginning I just wanted to solve things on my own. My way.� Thank you very much for this. The Exeter teachers were great. Breakfast and Lunch could have been changed a little bit.",
"CHERISEJOHNSON12 GMAIL: Very informative. A new way to think about learning. A new way to challenge teachers.� Loved it.� How to make tables for mixture problems.� EMI has changed the way I think about teaching and learning and how students can come to many conclusions on their own without much directing.� Not sure... ",
"BRHAMMEL GMAIL: It was a good experience  but I am hesitant only because the amount of time required was a little bit long. I also think the problems we had in class were way over the head of what I could use with my students  so I think there needs to be a better mix of problems - especially with middle school teachers or other teachers who don't normally teach math as part of the audience. I am not sure repeating the experience would be helpful  but I reserve judgement until I see how this year goes with trying to implement parts of it in my classroomIt helped me understand how groups and wait time can be used in the classroom and how a student centered classroom would look and feel. The meals were not great. Eating the same thing 4 days in a row was disappointing. I would have rather been told that lunch was on our own. If they are going to provide lunch again then I would also have the talk while people are eating and shorten lunch to 30 minutes. An hour was too long. I appreciate the opportunity to participate in something like this. I do think that having some type of meetings a few times per year with those we were in class with - even if they are virtual - would help everyone connect on how they have been able to implement what they learned and help each other with questions or obstacles that we have come against.",
"DPOLIQUIN BENEDICTINE: It offered stimulating math discussions and interactions with peers  plus the opportunity for networking. The math was extremely difficult for me. I don't have the math background or teaching experience that most other attendees seemed to possess. I was overwhelmed much of the time. I love the emphasis on visual learning that many of my classmates support. I was very impressed by the importance of the number manipulations/algorithms AND the drawings/pictures used to support their thinking! I really want to dig into more advanced math and tackle those problems we were given! I can also totally sympathize more with my students who struggle (as I did). Maybe EMI should only be offered for high school teachers? Or maybe it should have a required prerequisite in order to attend  such as a recent completion of Geometry  Algebra 2  etc. (Again  I'm new to teaching math and haven't taken these classes in years  so maybe it's just me!) Thanks SO MUCH for a great week!",
"RMIDDLETON NDSION:  It was good to sit in the student's seat for a change. It was nice to be challenged. Folding paper to get a parabola using 'patty' paper works great. Patty paper is the paper that is put between hamburger patties  is waxed on one side but not the other. It helped to show me how to implement learning through group work. I'd like to hear more about how Exeter classes work  how they evaluate their students  etc. ",
"LERICKSON149 GMAIL: For an opportunity to experience what it's like to be a student and what teaching grit looks like.� I would like to participate in different courses  however  working/sitting for 6 hours a day for four days was intense.The opportunity to empathize with students who have little motivation was a good experience.� Give us a lunch break to leave or have us bring our own lunch. Give us a head's up to bring graph paper and notebook paper.� Thank you for organizing EMI! The low cost was incredible considering the materials and professional development that we received. Thank you for acquiring the funds to offer us a stipend. I feel very valued and supported by your efforts.",
"IHDETMER SMSD: It was interesting to hear how different schools did things.� Empathy for students  increased critical thinking skills� I would like to see even more hands-on activities and varied routine. ",
"HEATHEROGLE SMSD: Good opportunity for immersing in meaningful problems. Wish more pedagogy techniques were discussed. It was beneficial for my teaching but I am not sure the take-aways for me outweigh the cost of being away from my family.Good immersion in problem-solving. More pedagogy techniques shown. It was basically the same strategies all week in your respective sessions. That would grow old for teenagers. ",
"DBALSMAN USD348: The ability to focus the course offerings to my direct needs made for a very positive and useful experience.� Participate in different courses. Different approaches to the same problem. By giving me resources that I can easily blend into my current classroom. Provide room numbers for courses. This would make the first day go smoother. ",
"MITCHELLD BISHOPMIEGE: EMI provided some of the best professional development I have received. I learned so much this week  but I would like to work with some of the first and second year curriculum. I learned a little bit about using Geogebra  which I have never used before. I see using this approach to better meet the needs of our students  since more of them are coming to us having already taken some algebra. Some people were complaining about the same lunch every day. Maybe arrange for a food truck (or two) on site one of the days for some variety. Thank you for bringing this to Kansas City!",
"JACLYNKOTOWSKI GMAIL:  Geared towards advanced students and I work with lower functioning students.� It takes time to come up with problems that students can access but will also challenge them to think more critically. Instructional level not frustration level.� Build math skills and I was able to network with different math teachers who have coteachers.� Build in more time to discuss how to implement this in the classroom especially with students who struggle with perseverance. Geometry Hands on should actually include hands on portions. ",
"THOGAN BLUEVALLEYK12: More hands on is needed  being that's the title of many of the courses. Better fit for algebra 2 & college algebra would have helped me. Work was tedious...though very do-able. Again  I would have liked to experience more true hands-on activities. And lunch was a kind gesture  but pitiful. It was interesting hearing so many other teachers present solutions. I think I learn a lot about how not to convey knowledge to others. One gentleman was particularly condescending. :( I like the idea of pressing students to solve more rigorous problems on their own. Their feeling of accomplishment and success will carry them through more difficult problems. More hands-on. Making us aware of the fact that the math has a geometry focus. I'm not sure the Exeter educators have a good understanding of what our public school gen-ed classes are really like. LUNCH! Thanks for the week. I know I complained a bit  but overall it was a good 4 days.",
"NWCHAMBE SMSD: Ideas on how they will be able to implement this in their classes  specifically not honors or higher level. Showed me a way to teach my student problem solving w/out just telling me  Hey use this method  it works  trust me.� Have more than just ham and turkey sandwiches. :-/ ",
"ARNIEKNUDSON SEABURYACADEMY: I learned about some websites that allow the students to practice drilling math facts as video games. I believe one was called arcademics.com. I also learned about geogebra as a tool for illustrating advanced concepts. I felt positive reinforcement in the classroom setting as a student. I felt like I learned some concepts and approaches i had not seen before. I would have liked a bit more time in the classroom reflecting on what was being modeled  how these approaches work in a transitioning classroom or with students who transfer in from elsewhere.� ",
"SHARPER02 BLUEVALLYK12: Different ways of thinking about problemsOrganization for the activities and change up groups ",
"TGROSPITCH BLUEVALLEYK12: I met some great people  and have access to some good problems  however  I'm not sure this helped me figure out a way to integrate problem solving into my curriculum using the constraints given to me by my curriculum and district scope and sequence. While there were some good problems  I didn't feel they were really action-oriented.Connections More variety for lunch. Turkey sandwich for 4 days is not very appealing. ",
"AFENNEWALD HOLDEN: I think EMI provided a unique opportunity to see a different way to run a mathematics classroom  but as a middle school teacher  I'm not sure this is something I can implement full scale. As was mentioned throughout the week  my absolute biggest take away from this week was remembering what it's like to struggle. I would have found it more beneficial to hear more background about how Exeter runs their class in general and some tips about how they help new students adjust to this method. I would've liked to hear more from the teachers about what their role looked like in the classroom. 7 hours a day for 4 days is a big commitment for a teacher in the summer  especially when I put 3 kids in day care and drove almost an hour to come. I truly enjoyed doing the math  experiencing the struggle  and connecting with other teachers  but two days would have sufficed it for me.� The little tips and tricks that other teachers shared along the way about how they teach certain concepts was very helpful. It was also wonderful to be mixed in with high school teachers (as I am a middle school teacher) so I could hear about some of the preferences they have for notations  etc. and this opened up dialogue with the high school teachers at my school It just felt good to be around other people that get it. We're all math teachers and that means we automatically have some things in common. It was great to work together with a bunch of other nerds! I would like to hear the class facilitators talk more about how they implement this method in their class. I heard the food was outstanding last year and was disappointed when we had the same thing for lunch every day. I'm not sure I needed a full week to get the experience. One of my facilitators did a fantastic job of asking questions about each problem we worked on to help us have really great discussions and try to draw out ALL the possible ways to work out problems (which was kind of an epiphany in itself for me that we need to help kids realize it's ok not to just follow a certain procedure to find a solution  but I digress)  but another one of my classes didn't have near as rich of discussions because we didn't share as much about our problems after we did them.� I am very grateful for the stipend that was offered to us. A big thank you to the people that made that happen. Also  Notre Dame de Sion was a beautiful location to have the session.",
"NOBLEDSO SMSD: Challenging problems and great lab ideas. It was an engaging hand-on experience.� I would love to try other courses.� I loved all the different ways of looking at a problem.� I am ready to start implementing labs in my classroom.",
"ASTEIN MIDWAYK12: The opportunity to think about math from a new perspective. The opportunity to see and discuss multiple ways of solving problems.The challenge of deciding how to approach a problem from multiple angles has helped me to build the communication piece necessary to gently prompt my students along as they struggle through new problems.� Lunch With my busy summer schedule  I would prefer a three day over a four day conference.",
"SOFASTM SMSD: It was a wonderful professional growth experience.� I enjoyed working the problems with other professionals. Just that there are so many talented/intelligent math teachers out there that really care about students. I'm excited about starting my academic school year and using many of these problems. A variety in lunches would be great! ",
"WESWYNEN SMSD: Networking with teachers in my state yet in different school districts. Higher level math education. Please advertise the courses appropriately. Hands-On Algebra 2 was really Hands-On Honors Pre-Calc. Had I known that I would have chosen both A1 courses to better serve my students. This course did nothing to serve my on-level Algebra 2 students.� As teachers we are seeking to best serve our students. Please let us know honestly what the courses are about  so we can choose appropriately. And make no mistake  educators with a background that includes  Smith  Mount Holyoke  Yale  Dartmouth  etc.  cannot necessarily provide the same real-world connections necessary to serve all students. While we all appreciate the support of these highly educated people  and will no doubt benefit from this experience  I would like for them to walk for just a minute in our shoes. When they have done that successfully with their methods  then I will truly know that it works.",

"MCALLAHAN AZIMAHEALTH: Not only were the activities that we did great  but the people that I met were awesome. It was an incredible learning experience and I can't wait to use what I learned. One of my classmates was shared her experiences at Julliard and how that affected her teaching and her story was just incredible. It gave me a chance to see that not only do all children learn differently  but also adults. Maybe change up the lunch Thank You",
"JENNIFER_STUTZER ISDSCHOOLS: Great resources.� Tough problems for my classroom.I plan to use these questions to begin my calculus class.",
"KMATTACCHIONE REGISJESUIT: Maybe if the institute was near my hometown  but otherwise  just grab a few colleagues together and do the problems.� We just worked through problems which we can do when convenient to our time.� I am always interested in hearing the good the bad and the ugly of classroom examples of lessons.� To give more time and deeper questioning to students so they become problem solvers.� I would like to hear a time this style of problems did not work. It sounds like these problems and the classrooms are perfect.� Thanks for giving me a new outlook and excitement to the coming years of my mathematics classroom.",
"JECONRAD2020 YAHOO: I was struggling & rather than guide me she asked me questions that allowed me to see the problem in a different way. Reminded me how it was to feel as a student  it allowed networking with other math teachers  and showed me how to effectively begin creating a student lead classroom. My only suggestion for improvement would be with meals  more variety and not so heavy on the carbs. ",
"ACARMAN BISHOPMIEGE: I am very likely to recommend the institute to another teacher because it changed the way I thought math classes should run. The spiraling method and labs were challenging and would keep the curriculum interesting.� Finding someone to watch my kids for 4 days was challenging and so I may or may not attend the institute again.� I really enjoyed hearing about teaching math in other districts from the participants. One thing I found interesting was a teacher who said her district said she couldn't flip her classroom anymore because the parents felt like she wasn't teaching. I have thought about the institute almost every day since. I really want to incorporate more labs and problem solving into my teaching from now on. I also want to have the students do more spiral learning.",
"CLAUDIA_PERRY ISDSCHOOLS: It was great to participate with other teachers in different places. It was intense and enlightening for working together as students would. How to share ideas that are not always easy to do. It made me stop and think how my students might feel if they don't understand a topic. Vary the lunch...same thing every day gets old. ",
"MMCCONNELL HORIZON-ACADEMY:  I just don't anticipate that I'll be attending it twice.I showed me a way to teach algebra inductively.",

"SARADZIADOSZ SMSD: Gives some excellent ideas that can be adapted if needed for SPED. It's not really designed to meet the needs of SPED student scaffolding. Resources like desmos.com  various hands-on tools I hadn't seen before. Got my brain thinking about how to take the activities and make them accessible to kids with learning disabilities.

Here's what I was able to think about/get from the experience: http://enraged2engaged.com/wp/",
"CSHAVER CHAMINADE-STL:  I find more value in the math packets themselves (available for free online) than in the week of being forced to work on them. I have enough advanced math education that I did not find some of the time working on problems to be very beneficial for me.Gave me the resources to incorporate well-designed problem-solving into my classes. Be clearer and more specific about what each class is planning to cover. I did not know  for example  that by signing up for Engaging Algebra I would be retaught Algebra 1. Thanks for offering this opportunity and for doing so at such a low cost! I know it was beneficial for a lot of people.",
"KSIRRIDGE STTERESASACADEMY: I would be most likely to recommend EMI to a private school teacher who has more flexibility in his/her curriculum. The Geometry sessions I attended last year were very helpful in opening my mind to a learning through struggle model-- something that was both useful and exciting in the classroom. (Exposure to this model could be helpful for both new and veteran teachers  given that they are willing and interested.) Having attended for two years  I can attest that the EMI experience depends entirely on the teachers you work with and the size and 'buy in' of your class itself. With the right attendees (enthusiastic  open-minded  communicative)  EMI would be a hard-to-top experience.� It is possible that I would attend in the future. Both years have been excellent in terms of attendee comfort (great food and accommodations!) My experience this year was not nearly as active  interactive  or collaborative as last year. (That appeared to be a function of the teacher and class group). This year  my EMI course was not as immersively modeled and did not create the same sense of camaraderie or accomplishment as last year's classes. Again  this was dependent on the particular class. Overall  STA and Rockhurst's hosting was terrific. The student greeters and delicious food were very popular! I enjoy working with colleagues outside of the school year  and for that reason  would consider attending again. My classmates were not interested in sharing. My EMI experience this year reminded me to treat all PD experiences as opportunities to search for valuable connections and conversations  even when others have a have to be here attitude. Connecting with other teachers to share methods  ideas  and 'battle stories' is invaluable-- and we never get enough of it! Perhaps there is a way to encourage more camaraderie and/or effortful participation among the 'students'. I noted less participant investment and connection this year. I know that many teachers hate 'icebreakers' and games (despite inflicting them on students!)  but there may be another way to encourage a sense of pride and identity among the cohort(s). This should technically fall on the EMI teachers themselves  but perhaps teacher participants at the hosting institution could lead it (or even student volunteers!). This might be best accomplished in the individual classes themselves.� Excellent hosting job. Fantastic accommodations  organization  and treats. The process was seamless and well-organized  right down to the 'cat choreography' on Thursday morning to add that celebratory flair to certificate distribution. Very nice touch! Thumbs up to all involved.",
"AMANDAPH HICKMANMILLS: It was a fantastic experience that I think teachers from all around could benefit from.� I had a great time.� Sadmep as a phrase in the classroom  similar to pemdas. It's a silly phrase but I think students connect to those  and it may help them remember better how to solve algebraic equations in order! It reconnected me to my excitement for challenging logic and math puzzles  which I will bring with me to my classroom.� nothing I can think of.� ",
"CEARRAJONESS YAHOO: I networked with a lot of great math teachers of all levels and gained many resources to help with my teaching.� Very informative.�",
"DSHAVER ROCKHURSTHS: It is a math-centered PD opportunity that allows for healthy discourse about educational pedagogy within a math classroom. No agenda or sales tactic is pushed but rather just a realistic discussion on how discussion  challenging problems  and student-centered learning can fit within our classrooms. I would happily attend again; it simply depends on timing. As a career high school math instructor it was nice to gain insight into a middle school math teachers approach to teaching certain Algebra concepts.� Has reinforced my belief that there are many positive outcomes that come from well-structured student-centered learning and discussion.� The lunch presentations felt a bit forced. It was interesting information but perhaps consolodate them to one day and allow for other discussion topics during lunch on other days. ",

Just goes too show you that any student it's capable of achieving at any level The biggest thing I came away with was the hands on approach that can be done with any lessons. And seeing an instructor force teachers to work together without her aid is something I want to bring into my classroom I'd like to see more ways to relate the activities to something we will be doing during the year.

A method of teaching completing the square with algebra tiles that helps it make sense visually. I enjoyed getting to know the other teachers and sharing our educational experiences .
